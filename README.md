![Recommended](Recommended.jpeg)

**Background:** Recommender systems have become a part of our daily life . While some sites might use those systems to improve the customer experience or increase sales , others are focused on customized advertising and suggestive marketing. 
As a book lover, I have always wondered where I can find good book recommendations. 


**Objective:** Understanding the demographics and other characteristics of the amazon books customers. This study will help us to be able to recommend books to read to the customers.The dataset used for this project was sourced from  Kaggle.



**Data:** The data set consists of information on amazon customers .
- `Books.csv` : information related to books 
- `Ratings.csv` : location and ratings
- `Users.csv` : age and user_id



The software used to analyse the data and answer the queries are:
 - Jupyter notebook
 - Tableau
