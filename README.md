# Recommended-Reading - Final_Project

![Recommended](Recommended.jpeg)

**Background:** Recommender systems have become a part of our daily life . While some sites might use those systems to improve the customer experience or increase sales , others are focused on customized advertising and suggestive marketing. 
As a book lover, I have always wondered where I can find good book recommendations. 


**Objective:** Understanding the demographics and other characteristics of the amazon books customers. This study will help us to be able to recommend books to read to the customers.The dataset used for this project was sourced from  Kaggle.



**Data:** The data set consists of information on amazon customers .
- `Books.csv` : information related to books 
- `Ratings.csv` : location and ratings
- `Users.csv` : age and user_id



The software used to analyse the data and answer the queries are:
 - Jupyter notebook
 - Tableau 



To manage the project I have been using Kanban Project Board

01. **Data Cleaning**

The first step of this project was cleaning the 3 dataset and saving them as new files before starting to analyse and built our recommendation system.

02. **Exploring the data**

Exploring data set


03. **Recommendation system**
- Simple recommenders
- Collaborative Filtering based Recommendation System
- User-based recommendation book system
- Collaborative Filtering Using k-Nearest Neighbors

04. **Tableau - Presenting the analysis**

Creation of a dashboard to represent the information
Queries exploring the data through Tableau


**Conclusion:**

For this project I tried to use different approch for the book recommendation. As we can see depending on the one we choose recommended books are not the same, and the complexity of the system is different.
Now I have a better understanding of what youtube , netflix ... are recommended me and why.


Over all, I felt like this was a good choice for a  project. The problem was interesting to me and also advanced enough to challenge me to learn more about data cleaning, how to deal with a data set  and machine learning algorithms used in recommendation engines. 

The datasets involved some preparation and cleaning, and more time could have been spent on it. For exemple on cleanning country and potentially states as USA is where most users are from . Also it would have been great to add a columnn for categories of books to make the recommendation more specific.
This project allowed me to improve my Python skills and learned how to use several packages that were new to me .
